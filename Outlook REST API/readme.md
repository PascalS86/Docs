# How to work with the Outlook REST API?
I'm a big fan of Cortana. Accessing the calendar, mails, contacts, etc. is a performance boost (at least in my opinion). But something, that annoyed me was the fact, that tasks, that were synced from Cortana to Microsoft to do never showed up in a way I can access through calendar apps e.g. on my phone (even though I'm using the Microsoft apps). So I decided to create an option to enable that. 

Hopefully, Microsoft will add this feature again. But who knows...

In this doc I write down the basic steps to create an app to work with those objects in general.
