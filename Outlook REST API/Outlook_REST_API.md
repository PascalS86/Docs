This is the description to work with the outlook REST API

# WORK WITH THE OUTLOOK REST API

Most of the things I use here were described and greatly documented on Microsofts Docs. So let's get into it. 


## PREREQUISITES
Before we can access the Outlook REST API we have to register and authenticate our app (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/office-365-api/api/version-2.0/use-outlook-rest-api#ShortRegAuthWorkflow). I already did this kinda thing in another doc ([Azure AD B2C](../BlazorClientSide/Azure_AD_B2C.md)). After we set it up, we can begin accessing the API.
