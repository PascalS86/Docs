# Pascals dev vault
Hello friends,

Your friendly neighborhood developer has decided to write down some of the stuff I do.
I'm tinkering around with a lot of technology that belongs to the rather broad field of IT.
Mostly I have a focus on AI and ML centered solutions, so I try to enrich my stuff with it.
But there's always some other stuff like cloud, dotnet (core) UI technology, drones, microcontroller, smart devices, etc...
My projects usually come across those things. And so, it makes sense to bring it to paper (or screen in this case).

As this covers most of the time my private projects, the focus is also on not spending to much cash.
Not everything has to be expensive to be fun :)
